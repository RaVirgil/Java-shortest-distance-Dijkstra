# Java-shortest-distance-Dijkstra
Java app for finding shortest distance between 2 given nodes in a huge graph. 

map2.xml has a bunch of nodes and edges as input.

To change starting point and ending point :

dijkstra.Run(graphNodes.get(1)) <- change the 1 here with your starting point
LinkedList<Nod> path = dijkstra.getPath(graphNodes.get(10)) <- change the 10 here with your end point
